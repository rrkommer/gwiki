{pageintro}
The Macro {{navbreadcrumb}} renders a unordered list of all parent elements of the current element.
{pageintro}

List contains all parent elements (top -> down). As example for the current page:

{navbreadcrumb}

To achieve a different css view of the first element, use the css selector: 
{code}
ul li:first-child
{code}


*Note:* Unlike the navigation on the left side, just parents are rendered to the list.
