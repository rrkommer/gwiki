How to store the GWiki files in a database instead of local file system.
{pageintro}
{pageattachments}{note}
Currently only Oracle is supported.
 The database layer to the gwiki virtual file system is not very complex, so it should quite simple to create interfaces to other databases.

h2. Introduction
The standard implementation to store GWiki files is a combination of GWiki files embeded in the Gwiki Jar and 
 local file system.
 The advantage of storing the files on the local file system is, that you are able to modify the files not only via the
 GWiki GUI, but also directly via text editor.
 You can also directly manage your GWiki files with a version control system like CVS or SVN.
 The disadvantage of this solution, you cannot use it in a clustered environment. 
 On some hosting systems you are also not allowed to access local directories.
h2. Setting up
It is very easy to setup Database with the gwikilauncher

h2. Using other databases
If you miss your Database driver in the dropdown, put the driver jar file into the libs subdirectory of your working directory.
Currently supported are:
* Derby Embedded
* Derby In Memory
* Postgres
* Oracle
If you miss your database, please open a ticket in GWikis Jira.
