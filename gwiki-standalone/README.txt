BUILDING Standalone

mvn assembly:assembly does'nt work inside eclipse 
( Failed to create assembly: Error adding file 'de.micromata.genome.gwiki:gwiki:jar:0.3.1-SNAPSHOT' to archive: C:\Users\roger\d\dhl\gwiki\gwiki\target\classes isn't a file.
  because this is directory...).

Building with cmd shell works.
